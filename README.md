# Moneta

Moneta is a full stack MERN platform for patients at any stage of Alzheimer's/Dementia to keep their mind and brain stimulated. Brain teasers/memory/image and word association games have been scientifically proven to be useful throughout the lives of people afflicted with the disease. While additionally, music can play an important role.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. They will also give an overview of some of the app's functionality. 

### Prerequisites

You will need MongoDB installed if you want to run this application locally. For help installing MongoDB, visit
````
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
````

Once installed, make sure the MongoDB daemon is running with the following command line command:
````
$ mongod
````

### Installing

Git clone the repository to your local machine: 

HTTPS:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fkarticuno/moneta.git
```
SSH:
````
$ git clone github.com:fkarticuno/moneta.git
````

To connect to your local Mongo database, you will need to add an .env file in the root of your cloned repository containing the following code:
````
MONGO_DB="mongodb://localhost/<you decide the name here>"
````

Next, cd into the repository you cloned and install the necessary dependencies by running:
````
$ npm install
````

You will then be able to start the app locally by runnning:
````
$ npm run dev
````
